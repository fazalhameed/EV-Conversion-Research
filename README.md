## Introduction

This research aims to explore the feasibility, challenges, and benefits of converting internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles into electric vehicles (EVs). With a focus on small to mid-sized cars and vans, this project investigates the technical, financial, and environmental aspects of EV conversions.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the technical requirements for converting ICE vehicles to EVs.
2. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EV conversions.
3. Assess the environmental impact of converting ICE vehicles to EVs.
4. Provide detailed case studies for the Mehran, Bolan, Town Ace, Baleno, and Land Rover Defender 110 (1990).

## Methodology

Our research methodology includes:
- Literature review on EV conversion processes and technologies.
- Technical analysis of the target vehicles.
